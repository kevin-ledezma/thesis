For my thesis defense in spring 2023, I hypothesized that life dissatisfaction would increase the odds of development of cognitive impairment among older Americans. I justified this hypothesis via a literature review, and then analyzed survey data from the University of Michiganâ€™s Health and Retirement Study, 2020 core. I fit a crude and adjusted logistic regression model in R to obtain odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, which showed a statistically insignificant relationship between life dissatisfaction and cognitive impairment, even after adjusting for covariates of interest such as depression before 16, risk taking, and depression symptoms. I aggregated life dissatisfaction measures from several instruments, ranging from memory to risk-taking and alcohol/drug use, which were inspired by telephone interviews for cognitive status scores. I used the tidyverse package for data management and ggplot2 for data visualization. The paper is available on request (email k.ledezma1998@gmail.com
